Fluid Frenzy allows you to visually debug the fluid simulation buffers in a custom debug editor window. The window can be opened by clicking the ![alt text](../../assets/images/simulation_debugger_bugbutton.png) button in the Fluid Simulation component or by clicking *Window > Fluid Frenzy > Debugger*.

In this editor you can see information about each of the fluid simulation's in your scene and it's buffers. The editor can be quite resource intensive due to it constantly refreshing, you can disable this by turning off the **Live** button.
